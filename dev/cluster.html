                                    help our businesses prosper while creating sustainable and systemic change.
                                    “Creation, not competition”.</p>
                                <p><strong class="color-brand">Purpose:</strong> To create an open-source model for
                                    adoption that invokes collaboration and cooperation for change-making businesses
                                    for the purpose of creating global change while helping businesses prosper.</p>
                                <p><strong class="color-brand">Vision:</strong> An online channel and marketplace to
                                    inspire, promote and create cooperation via Clusters of like conscious like-minded
                                    businesses (as opposed to the competition rat race that businesses are forced to
                                    compete in.)</p>
                                <p><strong class="color-brand">Problem Worth Solving:</strong> Competition can be fun
                                    and exciting, but it’s unsustainable on businesses, the planet and the planet’s
                                    inhabitants. Competition takes tolls on livelihoods and on the planet, and we
                                    believe that competition should be left in controlled environments that affect the
                                    planet as little as possible, or better yet, give back to the planet, and its
                                    inhabitants while promoting Creation through collaboration and cooperation. This
                                    can be done with conscious forward-thinking businesses who want to lead our human
                                    race through business to its next frontier.</p>

                                <p><strong class="color-brand">How Clusters Work::</strong> Clusters are grouped by
                                    global territory (e.g. North America, Asia Pacific, etc) and then segmented based
                                    on Professional Services, Leisure and Consumer Retail. Participants are called
                                    Partners and are invited to join where they elect their signature service to
                                    promote to their nominated Cluster and the greater business community. Each Partner
                                    is incentivised to transact within their Cluster as their first point of resource
                                    when obtaining a service because of Partner pricing that is afforded to Partners
                                    from other Partners. Marketing, advertising and promotion of the cluster happens
                                    primarily via other Partners marketing. Creatiq also sponsors advertising to the
                                    Marketplace website, driving targeted traffic of shoppers/consumers looking for
                                    specific services and are of like-mind.</p>
                                <p>[Hypothetically] Additionally, Partners donate a percentage of of each sale to a
                                    trust formed by the members, where each year proceeds are donated to a cause chosen
                                    by the Cluster. The trust is audited and reported on annually by an independent
                                    body. Each Cluster Partner decides on their Partner discount amount as well as
                                    their donation amount. As a suggestion, Creatiq provides a 10% discount to Cluster
                                    partners and 10% to the cause.</p>
                                <p>Creatiq Cluster is an open-sourced model and is duplicated across countries
                                    globally.</p>
                                <p>We will have a dedicated online marketplace that will be promoted by each Cluster
                                    Partner via their networks, and further marketing and advertising by Creatiq.</p>
