                        <p>Problem - The sustainability of our planet and its inhabitants are under threat as a direct
                            consequence of current models of competition. Meanwhile the global business community
                            remains reactive, even resistant, to any alternatives to combative marketplace culture. </p>
                        <p>Market - The global economy is drying up due to a lack of liquidity, largely the result of
                            multinationals failing to reinvest their fair share of taxation back into the system and
                            whales storing liquidity in offshore accounts instead of repatriating funds back into the
                            economies of their country. Small businesses, which are the cornerstone to a thriving
                            economy, are struggling to survive as funds which historically provided the resources for
                            public services and job-creation (through spending) are not circulating like they used to.
                            Creatiq intends on working with the conscious business community, from aspiring
                            entrepreneurs to small and medium-sized businesses, to foster harmonious cooperative
                            relationships that generate true prosperity for businesses and our local communities. </p>
                        <p>Simultaneously, Creatiq will has a soft focus on operators within the cannabis industry due
                            their positive disruption of the pharmaceutical industry and their growing influence in the
                            global economy. According to Business Insider, in California alone, annual cannabis sales
                            are estimated to have nearly doubled by the end of 2018. Marijuana Markets are projected to
                            reach $23.4 Billion by 2022, employing an estimated half a million Americans. </p>
                        <p>Competition is a fear-based tactic of the old business world which limits sustainable growth
                            and stifles the development of our society. Common healthy competition can generate ideas
                            and new solutions, but it comes at a cost to the environment and the mental health of
                            business operators and staff mainly because the true benefits end up in the hands of the
                            few at the top. By promoting and nurturing strategic alliances and sharing resources among
                            our client base, Creatiq intends to foster a new frontier of conscious businesses who can
                            enjoy true prosperity and fulfilling business outcomes. </p>
                        <p>Creatiq will drive business owners to focus on what inspires them. We will nurture strategic
                            alliances and the exchange of resources among our client base, so that they can all
                            leverage each other to reach their own goals. We will support clients through our
                            specialist knowledge and expertise for digital marketing and lead-generation in order to
                            get their businesses seen and growing. Through our combined skills and efforts, we intend
                            on growing our conscious business partners together while bettering our local communities.</p>
